%%% Notes! This is because the atsign-INBOOK citation type specifies EITHER
%%% editor or author, but not both. In my experiments with the harvard/dcu
%%% bibtex style (and presumably this applies to other styles too), bibtex
%%% ignores the editor information if author information exists in an
%%% atsign-INBOOK entry. atsign-INCOLLECTION is far more commonly used in my references,
%%% and in the absence of an editor I believe most bibtex styles will just
%%% ommit the editor from the reference - the chapter information will not
%%% end up in the in-text citation as you suggest it should be but at least
%%% there is a place to put the editor if necessary.
